# ASPNET
This contains demonstrations of my ASP.NET/VB.NET coding
Current main project is an implementation of the Las Vegas Dice Game (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Vegas_(board_game))
It saves state in SQL Server and allows multiple players each from their own laptop/mobile device via ASP.NET
The code handles managing changing turns between players etc.
